Hnadling CORS proxy

replace proxy in webpackDevServer.config.js 

proxy: { 
      "/api/**": { 
        target: 'http://localhost:8080', 
        secure: false, 
        pathRewrite: { '^/api': '' }
      }  
    },

following two did not work
webpack. config, after performance
devServer: { 
      proxy: { 
        "/api/**": {

          secure: false, 
          pathRewrite: { '^/api': '' }
        }  
      }
   }
